Introduction
============

MOXελ is a Python package to ease and accelerate through **parallelization**, the
**calculation of** voxelized potential energy surfaces, or simply **energy voxels**,
with emphasis on reticular chemistry.

These energy voxels can then be used as a raw input for Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms or for manual feature extraction.

.. _advantages:

Why ΜΟΧελ?
----------

First of all, why energy voxels?

    *Interactions are the quintessence of chemistry*, completely characterizing
    the behavior (properties) of a material. The *potential energy surface
    (PES)* succinctly describes these interactions and as such, it is the most
    informative input that can be fed into a ML algorithm. Since the PES is a
    continuous function, *voxelization is necessary to convert the PES into a
    machine understandable format*.

Remember, *there is no free lunch*! Getting the most informative input is
computationally expensive. Fortunately, since **all calculations in MOXελ are
parallelized**, the **computational cost is significantly decreased**.

**All you need is a** ``.cif`` **!**

Objective
---------

The majority of time in a ML workflow goes into constructing the inputs and
making sure they are clean, rather than focusing on the ML part itself.

MOXελ aims to provide a **simple and fast interface to generate energy voxels in
a ML-ready format**, minimizing as much as possible the time spent on these
preprocessing steps.

Please note that MOXελ focuses only on energy voxels. If you want to fill the
voxels with other values or employ a different featurization scheme, check
`mofdscribe <https://mofdscribe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.
