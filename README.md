MOXελ is a Python package for **parallel calculation of energy voxels**, with
emphasis on reticular chemistry.

The majority of time in a ML workflow goes into constructing the inputs and
making sure they are clean, rather than focusing on the ML part itself.

MOXελ aims to provide a **simple and fast interface to generate energy voxels in
a ML-ready format**, minimizing as much as possible the time spent on these
preprocessing steps.

## ⚙️  Installation
```sh
pip install pymoxel
```
It is recommended to perform the installation inside a virtual environment.

## 📖 Usage
Documentaiton will be soon available.
