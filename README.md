MOXελ is a Python package for **parallel calculation of energy voxels**, with
emphasis on reticular chemistry.

The majority of time in a ML workflow goes into constructing the inputs and
making sure they are clean, rather than focusing on the ML part itself. MOXελ
aims to provide a **simple and fast interface to generate energy voxels in a
ML-ready format**, minimizing as much as possible the time spent on these
preprocessing steps.

## ⚙️  Installation
Package will be soon released in PyPi.

## 📖 Usage
Documentaiton will be soon available.
